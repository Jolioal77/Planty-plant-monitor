# Planty-plant-monitor
A device that monitors a plant and sends real data to an app that then uses the data to give the user tips on how to improve plant care. 
It uses the ESP32 as the microcontroller and the brain of the device. It uses a DHT11 for temperature, and ldr to sense the UV light and a soil moiture sensor to sense the soil moisture. 
The sensors send data to the ESP32 and the ESP32 send the live-data to the app using bluetooth. The app then tells the user and gives them suggestions on how to manage the plant. 
The app has a built-in AI companion called Planty and helps the user determine what to do with the plant at different stages of its life. Whether your plant is dying or still an embryo, Planty can help you get the best possible results out of your plant.
